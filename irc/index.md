title: IRCv3 Specifications
---

### IRCv3.1
Right now the IRCv3 specification is distributed as a series of extension specifications to IRC protocol version 2.7, also known as [RFC1459](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459). To understand the basis of the IRC version 3 protocol, please read RFC1459 followed by the extension specifications. A unified specification draft is being worked on which will replace RFC1459 at a later date.

Each version of IRCv3 contains base extensions, which comprise the core functionality of the IRC version 3 client protocol, and optional extensions, which comprise the extended functionality of the protocol.

This is the current released version of the IRC protocol.

### IRCv3.2
The IRCv3 Working Group also maintains a registry of "work-in-progress" extensions that have not yet been accepted as part of an IRC protocol version. IRC software vendors may provide additional extensions that have not yet been added to this registry. We recommend that extensions not in the registry use appropriate namespacing as described in the capability negotiation specification and in the message tags specification.

To submit an extension to the extension registry, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html) via IRC for now (`irc.freenode.net #ircv3`). Extension specifications should be submitted in Markdown format.

This is an unreleased version of the IRC protocol.
