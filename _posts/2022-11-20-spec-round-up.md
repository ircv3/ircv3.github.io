### Other

We have reorganized the main [specifications page]({{ site.baseurl }}/irc/) to group related specs together in a more logical manner given the recent additions.

Finally, do check the support tables to see how adoption of our specs is coming along, there've been a bunch of busy implementations over the past year; especially [Goguma](https://sr.ht/~emersion/goguma/), a new Android client spearheading many draft specifications.
