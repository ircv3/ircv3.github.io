title: Feb 2026 round-up

---

We missed the November 2025 update, so this is a summary of working group activity since Nov 2024.

### Specs ratified

* Feb 2026 [`reply` client tag](https://ircv3.net/specs/client-tags/reply) - Allows clients to mark messages as being a reply to another message or thread. Also enables the draft `react` client tag [#535](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/535)
* Feb 2026 [Websockets](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/websocket) - Describes conventions for transporting IRC lines over the WebSocket protocol. This is necessary for browser-based clients, which cannot make conventional TCP connections to IRC servers [#548](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/548)

### New drafts

* Apr 2025 [`extended-isupport`](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/extended-isupport) - Allows clients to fetch the ISUPPORT metadata prior to connection registration, introduces a new command to fetch ISUPPORT and a new batch type to delimit ISUPPORT bursts [#543](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/543)
* Nov 2025 [`network-icon`](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/network-icon) - Introduces a new ISUPPORT token to advertise a network icon [#563](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/563)

### Specs updated

* Feb 2026 [Metadata](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/metadata) - Loosened the requirement to filter keys from RPL_WHOISKEYVALUE [#575](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/575) and various changes and clarifications to batch types, key names and registration behaviour [#566](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/566)
* Feb 2026 [`client-batch`](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/client-batch) - Added `FAIL` codes: `INVALID_REFTAG` and `UNKNOWN_TYPE` [#573](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/pull/573)
