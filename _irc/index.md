Right now the IRCv3 specification is distributed as a series of extension
specifications to IRC protocol version 2.7, also known as
[RFC1459](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459). To understand the basis of the
IRC version 3 protocol, please read RFC1459 followed by the extension
specifications.

IRCv3 is based on a set of specifications. Initially these specifications were
released as a versioned distribution â€“ these days, however, each specification
is released when it is stable and has been widely tested.

Errata updates may be submitted for our specifications. To do so, simply see
our [contribution](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
document.

## Capability Negotiation

Capability negotiation is a vital part of IRCv3. Capabilities let us implement
protocol changes in backwards-compatible ways, as well as convey various
information on joining a server.

CAPs are the primary way that IRCv3 features are enabled. As such, most
software implementing IRCv3 extensions will want to implement capability
negotiation.

The [v3.1 Capability Negotiation spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/capability-negotiation-3.1.html)
conveys the basic listing and requesting of capabilities, and lays the
framework which most IRCv3 specs use.

The [v3.2 Capability Negotiation spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/capability-negotiation-3.2.html)
clarifies how to list large numbers of capabilities (which is needed as we add
more useful features to IRCv3!). It also allows capabilities to be listed with
values, improving the implementation of features like SASL.

The [`cap-notify` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/cap-notify-3.2.html)
allows clients to be sent notifications when caps are added to or removed from
the server. This is useful in cases like SASL when the authentication layer
disconnects (and thus, SASL authentication is no longer possible). This
extension is **automatically enabled** if clients request v3.2 capability
negotiation.


## [Message Tags]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/message-tags-3.2.html)

Message tags extend the core framing used with IRC messages, and allow extended
data to be send with messages. Tags are used by a number of extensions, and we
consider them a core part of IRCv3 and of supporting new extensions.

This feature is considered essential and all software implementing IRCv3
**must** implement at least the core Message Tags specification.

The [core Message Tags spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/message-tags-3.2.html)
covers the required message changes, how tag data is formatted and escaped, and
how they are named.

The **work-in-progress** [`message-tags` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/message-tags-3.3.html)
covers allowing clients to send capabilities directly between each other,
allowing for new features to be developed and implemented independently from
the IRCd itself (similar to extensions based on CTCP).

**Note:** Message tags themselves are used as a foundation for other extensions
and do not themselves offer any user-facing features. Specific message tags are
defined in the various IRCv3 specifications.

## Account Tracking

IRCv3 extensions allow clients to much more easily know when other users are
logged into accounts. This allows for much greater integration between client
bots and the network's authentication system, as well as better general display
and authentication of client identifies.

The [`account-notify` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/account-notify-3.1.html)
defines a way for clients to be notified when other clients login to accounts.
This spec defines the `ACCOUNT` message to enable this, use of the `a` WHOX
token, as well as outlining the general restriction of account names not being
`*` (as this is used to indicate logging out of accounts).

The [`account-tag` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/account-tag-3.2.html)
defines a way for clients to receive a message tag on messages specifying the
current account that other client is logged into (or that they aren't logged
into one at all). This is especially useful for letting bots make use of the
network's authentication and account mechanisms.

The [`extended-join` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/extended-join-3.1.html)
defines a way to request that extra client information (including that client's
account) is sent when clients join a given channel. This allows better tracking
of accounts, particularly when used with `account-notify`.


## [Away Notifications]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/away-notify-3.1.html)

The `away-notify` extension provides a way for clients to instantly know when
other clients go away or come back. This improves responsiveness and the
display of channels for IRC clients that display this information.

The [`away-notify` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/away-notify-3.1.html)
describes how to sign up for these notifications and the `AWAY` message to
enable this. 


## [Batches]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/batch-3.2.html)

The `batch` extension provides a way for servers to mark certain messages as
related. This can simplify the display of this information in clients as well
as allow better post-processing on them.

The [`batch` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/batch-3.2.html) describes
the naming of new batch types, the semantics of batches and how clients should
process them.

**Note:** Batches themselves are used as a foundation for other extensions and
do not themselves offer any user-facing features. For specific batch types, see
the [batch types]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/batch-types.html) page.


## [Changing Usernames and Hostnames]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/chghost-3.2.html)

The `chghost` extension lets clients more easily see when other clients'
usernames and/or hostnames are changed. This replaces the clunky method of
sending a fake `QUIT`, and then one or more fake `JOIN` messages instead.

The [`chghost` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/chghost-3.2.html)
describes the new `CHGHOST` message which this extension uses, and how clients
see these changes.


## [Echo Message]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/echo-message-3.2.html)

The `echo-message` extension lets clients confirm when messages are sent, and
see messages that other clients on their connection (say, via an IRC bouncer)
have sent. It does this by echoing messages back to clients after they are
sent, allowing for these extra features.

A specification describing message IDs will be proposed soon. This should allow
clients to make full use of this spec and automatically hide duplicate messages
as appropriate, which come as a result of this extension.

The [`echo-message` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/echo-message-3.2.html)
describes which messages are echo'd, and how they are interpreted by clients.


## [Invite Notify]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/invite-notify-3.2.html)

The `invite-notify` extensions allows privileged channel users to see when
someone is invited to their channel. This can help chanops better run their
channels and see better information about what's going on.

The [`invite-notify` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/invite-notify-3.2.html)
describes the new `INVITE` reply which this extension uses, and how clients
interpret these notifications.


## [Monitor]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/monitor-3.2.html)

The `MONITOR` command acts as a standardized way for clients to be alerted when
other clients enter or exit the network. This is in opposition to `ISON`, which
does this through polling, and `WATCH`, which differs between vendor
implementations.

The [Monitor spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/monitor-3.2.html) details this
command, the relevant `RPL_ISUPPORT` token and the commands used with it.


## [Multiple Prefixes]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/multi-prefix-3.1.html)

The `multi-prefix` extension allows clients to see all the statuses
(i.e. voice, chanop) that other clients have in a channel rather than just the
highest. This improves data tracking for clients and bots, and allows clients
to display the privilege level of other clients more correctly.

The [`multi-prefix` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/multi-prefix-3.1.html)
details the exact messages these changes apply to and how exactly it's used.


## SASL Authentication

SASL allows users to authenticate in a standardised way across different IRC
networks. This is in opposition to logging in with 'services' such as NickServ,
and provides a pre-registration way to authenticate. Because SASL allows
authentication before registration, it allows clients to join certain types of
restricted channels much more effectively.

The [v3.1 SASL spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/sasl-3.1.html) defines
the `AUTHENTICATE` command and `sasl` cap, which work together to allow clients
to authenticate to the network.

The [v3.2 SASL spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/sasl-3.2.html) defines
a way to advertise the authentication methods available to clients, allows for
clients to re-authenticate after services is lost and reconnects, and defines
what to do if the authentication layer is disconnected or reconnected.


## [Server Time]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/server-time-3.2.html)

The `server-time` extension allows clients to see the exact time that messages
were sent and received. This allows bouncers to replay information with more
accurate time tracking.

The [`server-time` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/server-time-3.2.html)
describes the `time` tag, how to specify timestamps and how clients should
parse incoming timestamps.


## [Server Name Indication (SNI)]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/sni-3.3.html)

SNI makes it easier for servers to send the correct TLS certificate to
connecting clients.

The **work-in-progress** [SNI spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/sni-3.3.html) provides
guidelines for clients and servers, allowing them to better detect the TLS
certificate to send based on the server's hostname.


## [STARTTLS]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/tls-3.1.html)

STARTTLS allows clients to upgrade their plaintext connections to use TLS
encryption. It is recommended that clients instead implement STS support when
that is ratified as a stable IRCv3 standard.

The [`tls` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/tls-3.1.html) describes how
the `STARTTLS` command works, as well as how connection registration is changed
by the introduction of this capability.


## [Strict Transport Security (STS)]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/sts-3.3.html)

STS allows clients to be automatically upgraded to use TLS encryption and
prevents downgrade attacks. STS is intended as a replacement for the `STARTTLS`
command with better security qualities.

The **work-in-progress** [`sts` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/sts-3.3.html)
describes the `sts` capability, how it operates, and various implementation
details for both clients and servers.


## [Userhosts in NAMES]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/userhost-in-names-3.2.html)

The `userhost-in-names` extension allows clients to more easily see the
user/hostnames of other clients when joining channels. This allows clients to
better track info and automate client features more easily.

The [`userhost-in-names` spec]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/extensions/userhost-in-names-3.2.html)
describes how the `NAMES` message changes with this capability active, and how
clients should interpret the changes.

# Deprecated Extensions

These extensions have been explicitly **deprecated**. We no longer recommend
implementing them. Generally, these extensions have either been superseded,
or other major implementation issue have been discovered with them.


## [v3.2 Metadata]({{site.baseurl}}/specs/core/metadata-3.2.html)

The v3.2 `METADATA` command was found to have issues related to rate-limiting
and excessive notifications, which made it impossible for servers in widespread
use to implement. A new Metadata specification is being written to address
these issues and overhaul the notification system, so we do not recommend
implementing this spec.
